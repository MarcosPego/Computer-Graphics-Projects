To build a new release version the user needs to go to
code/source/CGJ/project/CGJ/CGJ.sln 
and open the file in Microsoft Visual Studio.

Then select release mode x64 and run the program. 
It will then create a folder called release in
code/

Please make sure to include the dlls on
code/source/CGJ/bin

And it is also needed to at least have the folder
assets located in:
code/source/CGJ/project/CGJ/source/assets
and shaders located in:
code/source/CGJ/project/CGJ/source/graphics/shaders

Please keep in mind that the folders assets and shaders contain assets needed
to run please do not change them.


Located inside the code/release folder the structure should be like this:
code/release/source/assets
code/release/source/graphics/shaders

the final release folder should look like this:
code/release/source/assets
code/release/source/graphics/shaders
code/release/CGJ.exe
code/release/glew32.dll
code/release/glew3.dll
code/release/install.txt //optional
