# Computer Graphics Projects
 
This repository contains two C++ projects that implement a simple graphic scene using OpenGL.

## Coconut Island - Coral Reef

The beauty and simplicity of watching water ripple around an island is 
mesmerizing. The goal of this project is to try to capture it as much as 
possible.

The main concept tackled in this project is the creation of realistic water
around an island.

This project was solo developed for the course of Graphics Engine for Computer Games

## Peaceful Breeze

A small scene containing a tree surrounded by procedurally generated grass which is
enhanced by post-processing features and shadows to create beautiful scenes that can
be captured

My contribution to this project was mostly around the toon shading effect and shadow-mapping.

This project was developed as between 4 students for the course of Animation and 3D Visualization
